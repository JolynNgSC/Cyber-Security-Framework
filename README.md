# Cyber-Security Framework
This research was done with the intention to learn and expand my knowledge of the cybersecurity field. Frameworks such as NIST Cyber Security Framework, ISO27002 or CIS Critical Security Controls are crucial to protect any companies. 

## National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

NIST is a framework that provides guidance for organizations within critical infrastructure sectors to reduce the risk associated with cyber security (Almuhammadi & Alsaleh, 2017). 


## IS027001 and ISO27002
IS027001's Process

ISO27002's Process

ISO/IEC 27001 sets out the criteria for creating, executing, sustaining, and enhancing an information security management system (ISMS). This standard establishes a structured approach for organizations to systematically oversee and safeguard their information assets, irrespective of their size or sector. It mandates elements such as risk evaluation and mitigation, managerial dedication, internal evaluations, and ongoing enhancement.

On the other hand, ISO/IEC 27002 serves as a practical guidebook, outlining best practices and recommendations for deploying controls aimed at addressing the information security risks outlined in ISO/IEC 27001. Unlike ISO/IEC 27001, which defines the prerequisites for an ISMS, ISO/IEC 27002 furnishes insights and directives on specific measures that organizations can adopt to mitigate information security risks. It encompasses various facets of information security, including organizational protocols, personnel security, physical and environmental safeguards, access management, encryption, and more.
